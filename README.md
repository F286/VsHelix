# VsHelix

VsHelix is a minimal Visual Studio extension that explores a Helix/Kakoune style
"selection first" editing workflow.  It uses Visual Studio's built in multi
cursor functionality as the state store.  The project currently implements a few
basic commands inspired by Helix.

## Building and Running

1. Install **Visual Studio 2022** with the *Visual Studio extension development*
   workload.
2. Open `VsHelix.sln` in Visual Studio.
3. Press **F5** to launch an Experimental Instance of Visual Studio with the
   extension automatically loaded.
4. Open any text file in the experimental instance.  Use
   `Ctrl+Alt+Click` to place additional carets.
5. With the extension loaded you can use the following keys:
   - `w` – extend each caret to the start of the next word.
   - `d` – delete the text in all active selections.
   - `c` – change the selections (delete then place the carets for insertion).

The provided `VsHelixPackage` is a standard AsyncPackage.  Command handlers are
added via MEF exports.  When the project is built in *Release* configuration it
produces `bin/Release/VsHelix.vsix` which can be installed by double clicking
or using `VSIXInstaller.exe`.

## Project Goals

- Prototype selection‑first commands similar to the Helix editor.
- Use Visual Studio's `IMultiSelectionBroker` API to track selections and
  perform transformations.
- Keep the code base small and easy to extend.

## Repository Layout

- `VsHelixPackage.cs` – Package entry point.
- `VsHelix.csproj` – Project definition and SDK references.
- `source.extension.vsixmanifest` – Extension manifest used by Visual Studio.

The core logic lives in `HelixCommandHandler.cs` which intercepts typed
characters and manipulates the current selections via
`IMultiSelectionBroker`.
